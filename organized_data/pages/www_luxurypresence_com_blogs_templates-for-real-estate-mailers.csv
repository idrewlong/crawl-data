Consistency : You may not get a response on your first postcard, or even your third, but continuing to reach out keeps your brand top of mind with your audience, building trust and familiarity over time.

Whether you’re promoting a new listing or building brand awareness, these options can help elevate your marketing strategy. 1. Introduction postcard Sending a postcard introducing yourself to your farming area is a strategic move to establish your presence and build trust within the community. The ideal time to send this postcard is when you first begin targeting a specific neighborhood, allowing you to make a strong first impression. It’s essential to include your professional background, your expertise in the area, and any unique value you offer. This postcard should be the first step in an ongoing campaign, helping you stay top-of-mind with potential clients as they recognize your name and services. By consistently sending postcards, you reinforce your commitment to the area and create a lasting connection with residents, positioning yourself as the go-to real estate expert. 2. Just-listed real estate postcards and mailers Just-listed postcards are a great way to spread awareness about your new listings. They help you generate leads while building your brand and establishing a touchpoint for future clients. A fantastic way to enhance the success of your just-listed postcards is with circle prospecting. This means sending out your mailers to people living near the listed home. You should view this as both a short and long-term marketing strategy. Not only can you generate immediate leads, but this will also help you build solid name-brand recognition in those areas over time. 3. Free home valuation invitation postcards Offering a free home valuation can get your foot in the door with potential sellers. Knowing how much their home is worth may be enough to move homeowners from thinking about selling to actively pursuing listing their property. Make sure to emphasize your professional expertise and show that you provide value they can’t get from the internet alone. It’s best to send out these free home valuation postcards at the start and end of the real estate high season, which in many markets means just before May and again toward the end of July. 4. Fence-sitter buyer real estate postcards These postcards are great for potential homebuyers with cold feet about following through on a home purchase. This is especially common with first-time homebuyers who may be unconvinced about the benefits of homeownership. You can use these postcards to encourage prospective buyers to make a move by introducing time-sensitive information about the home market or your services. For example, a discount offer with a hard deadline can nudge homebuyers off the fence. 5. Farming real estate postcards Farming with real estate postcards is more than a one-off marketing tactic; it’s a long-term campaign strategy designed to establish consistent brand awareness and trust within a specific geographic area or niche audience. To deploy this effectively, postcards should be sent regularly — ideally once a month or at least quarterly — to maintain a steady presence in the community. The messaging should vary with each mailing to keep the content fresh and engaging. For example, you might showcase recent market trends, send regular market reports , highlight a just-sold property, promote an upcoming open house, or provide valuable tips for buyers and sellers. By maintaining consistency in timing and delivering varied, relevant messages, you position yourself as the go-to real estate expert in the area. 6. Open house postcards Open houses are a tried and true marketing method for listing agents. Boost the attendance of your next one and generate valuable leads with open house real estate mailers. Simply send these postcards to your leads and other neighborhood homeowners the week before the showing. 7. Special event real estate postcards Special events can be a fantastic way to draw in prospective buyers and sellers. Consider hosting a trivia night, real estate seminar, holiday reception, or party. Getting even a single client from an event can make it worth the cost. At these events, collect information from warm leads so you can follow up with them later. 8. Homeowner tip postcards The agent-client relationship shouldn’t stop once they sign the closing documents. Sending regular follow-up messages with helpful home maintenance tips can help you add value and maintain an ongoing relationship with clients. You can also send these postcards to prospects, demonstrating that your homeownership knowledge extends beyond transactions. Consider sharing home care tips specific to each season. In autumn, you could remind homeowners to clear fallen leaves from gutters. In winter, you might offer suggestions on preventing freezing pipes; summer might bring tips on proper in-ground pool cleaning. 9. Renter postcards Renters present a vast pool of potential first-time homebuyers. You can offer valuable insights emphasizing homeownership’s advantages, such as the opportunity to build equity and secure a fixed monthly mortgage payment. To build a mailing list specifically targeting renters, start by identifying areas or neighborhoods with a high percentage of rental properties. You can obtain this data from public records, census data, or specialized real estate software tools. Additionally, partner with property management companies or landlords who may be willing to share information about their tenant base or allow you to distribute materials to their residents. Pay attention to online rental listings and housing platforms where renters may be searching for properties, and use those leads to build your list. 10. Recipe postcards Adding seasonal recipes to your real estate mailers is a fun way to provide value and share your personality with prospects. Suppose you hit it out of the park with a stellar recipe. In that case, your mailer might even earn a permanent spot in your prospect’s home, reinforcing that brand recognition every time they bake white chocolate zucchini bread or make a delicious chana masala. Real estate mailer FAQs Real estate mailers can be a powerful marketing tool, but they can also become costly without a clear strategy. To help you make the most of your investment, we’ve answered some of the most common questions agents have about using mailers effectively. What are real estate mailers? Real estate mailers encompass various types of direct mail designed to enhance brand recognition and generate leads. Although commonly postcards, they can also include letters, brochures, pamphlets, or other formats. Are real estate mailers worth it? Real estate postcards can absolutely be worth it, especially for agents looking to build brand awareness, establish a presence in a specific farming area, or connect with potential clients in a tangible, memorable way. While it can be challenging to track the immediate results of a mailing campaign, consistent postcard marketing often pays off over time as it keeps your name top-of-mind with your audience. On average, agents might spend anywhere from $0.50 to $1.50 per postcard, including design, printing, and postage. For a campaign targeting 500 homes monthly, this could add up to $250 to $750 per month. The key is to balance costs with a well-defined strategy, sending postcards regularly and tailoring your messages to engage your audience effectively. How effective are real estate postcards? According to the 2024 Direct Mail Marketing Benchmark Report conducted by Sequel, direct mail continues to be a powerful and effective marketing channel. The report found a strong upward trend in direct mail investments, with 61% of marketers increasing their spending over the past 12 months, marking a significant 12% rise from 2023. Furthermore, 96% of respondents reported improved or consistent performance, with 72% of consumers interacting with mail on a weekly basis and nearly one-third engaging with it daily. Direct mail’s influence on purchasing decisions is particularly compelling, ranking as the second most favored advertising medium after TV and video streaming. Moreover, 66% of marketers report a cost per acquisition of less than $150 — a share that’s increased significantly from just 29% in 2023. With 42% of consumers visiting URLs included in direct mail pieces, it’s clear that this tactic continues to be a powerful tool in modern marketing.
