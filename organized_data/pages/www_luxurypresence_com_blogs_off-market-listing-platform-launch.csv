Agents can choose to share within their brokerage only, match one-to-one with agents who have qualified buyers, handpick a shortlist of agents, or broadcast to everyone on the platform. Private Listings Hub taps into one of the largest buyer pools in the industry, matching listings against more than 300,000 active buyer needs. That demand is powered by a community of high-performing agents representing over $300 billion in annual sales , ensuring each private listing gains meaningful exposure to proven, trusted professionals. The launch comes as the National Association of Realtors (NAR) clarified key elements of the Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP). First, “office exclusives” may be shared one-to-one with another broker, something Private Listings Hub enables through intelligent agent-to-agent matchmaking. Second, a new “delayed marketing status” allows listings to be added to the multiple listing system (MLS) and promoted during a pre-market phase before hitting the IDX feed. Private Listings Hub supports both scenarios, offering agents the flexibility to market listings as selectively or as widely as needed. “The MLS is a great tool, and for most sellers, listing publicly is the best way to get maximum exposure and top dollar,” said Malte Kramer. “But some sellers care more about privacy or want to test the waters before going public. Private Listings Hub gives agents a flexible way to promote off-market and pre-market properties. It also gives them the control they need to follow the new NAR guidelines while still catering to each seller’s unique needs.” Unlike broad listing sites, Private Listings Hub empowers agents to post exclusive listings privately, controlling exactly who sees each property. Agents can also input buyer criteria and get notified when relevant off-market opportunities surface, creating a two-sided matchmaking system built for precision and trust. “I work with many high-profile clients who value privacy, so having the option to market privately on the Luxury Presence platform is a huge advantage,” said Jade Mills , who has sold over $9 billion in her career. “The platform makes it easy to share private listings and collaborate with other top agents. It’s a powerful way to surface opportunities and elevate the level of service we deliver to our clients.” Private Listings Hub builds on Luxury Presence’s January release of the Brokerage Listing Network , a CCP-compliant solution for brokerages to manage office exclusives. Together, the tools give agents new, sophisticated ways to promote off-market and pre-market listings, backed by a growing community of top performers and extensive buyer demand. Key benefits of Private Listings Hub Intelligent matchmaking: Connect instantly with agents representing qualified buyers, thanks to Luxury Presence’s database of 300,000+ active buyer needs. Total control, maximum discretion: Decide who sees price, location, and photos. Share with your brokerage only, handpick agents, or broadcast across the platform. Exclusive, trusted community: Access a vetted network of 60,000 agents and 14,000 real estate businesses representing over $300 billion in annual sales. Branded client experience: Seamlessly share private listings with clients within a secure, branded environment, including engagement tracking. Easy integration: Private Listings Hub is built into the Luxury Presence ecosystem, spanning websites, contact management, and mobile apps for effortless adoption. “I run a boutique brokerage with a family office approach — every seller gets a tailored strategy based on their goals,” said Maggie Gold Seelig , founder of MGS Group Real Estate. “A significant portion of my business is off-market, where success comes from relationships and targeted reach. Luxury Presence’s platform makes that easier by streamlining collaboration and helping surface the right connections.” The new platform will roll out to existing Luxury Presence customers over the next three weeks. After that, it will become available to all qualified agents, including those not yet on the Luxury Presence platform.
