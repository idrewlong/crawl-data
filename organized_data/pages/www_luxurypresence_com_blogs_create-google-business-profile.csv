This post will guide real estate professionals through how to create Google Business Profiles and explain why they play such a major role in search engine optimization and marketing strategies. Find It Fast Why real estate agents should create Google Business Profiles Formerly known as Google My Business, Google Business Profiles are powerful tools for real estate agents, helping them connect with potential clients and build trust from the very first search. Increases online visibility When potential clients search for real estate services in your area, a Google Business Profile helps your business appear prominently in search results and on Google Maps. This increased visibility can lead to more inquiries, as clients can easily find your contact information, business hours, and even directions to your office. Builds credibility and trust The reviews, photos, and detailed business information on an optimized Google Business Profile provide a snapshot of professionalism and quality service. Clients are more likely to choose a real estate agent with a strong online presence and positive reviews, as these factors contribute to perceived trustworthiness. Improves client engagement Clients can easily call, message, or request directions directly from your profile. Additionally, by responding to reviews and posting updates, you can engage with clients in real time, demonstrating your commitment to excellent customer service . This ongoing interaction can foster stronger relationships with clients and increase the likelihood of repeat business and referrals. Offers SEO benefits A Google Business Profile plays a significant role in local search engine optimization (SEO). By providing Google with accurate and consistent business information, you increase the chances of appeasing the algorithms and appearing higher in local search results when clients search for real estate agents. This improved SEO can drive more traffic to your website and generate more leads, directly impacting your bottom line.

If you already have one, sign in; if not, create an account by visiting accounts.google.com . It’s best to use the email address that’s associated with your real estate brokerage for this purpose. Step 2: Visit the Google Business Profile website Once you’re signed in, navigate to business.google.com . Click on the Get Started button to begin the setup process. Step 3: Enter your business name Type in your business name exactly as you want it to appear online. Consistency is key, so make sure this matches the name used on your website and other online profiles. If your business name includes your personal name and brokerage (e.g.: Jane Doe Homes at XYZ Realty), enter it accordingly. Step 4: Select your business category Choosing the correct business category is crucial, as it helps Google determine where your profile should appear in search results. Type “Real Estate Agent” or choose a similar category that best describes your services. If your services are more varied, you can add additional categories later. Step 5: Add your location If you have a physical office that clients can visit, enter the address. This information allows your business to appear on Google Maps and in local search results. If you operate from home or do not want to disclose your address, you can choose the option to hide it after your initial set-up. We also recommend that you specify the areas you serve, which is particularly useful for real estate agents who cover multiple neighborhoods or cities. Step 6: Enter your contact information Provide your phone number and website URL . This allows clients to contact you directly from your Google Business Profile. Ensure that your contact details are accurate and consistent with those on your website and other marketing materials. Step 7: Verify your business To ensure that the information provided is accurate and that you are authorized to manage the business profile, you will need to verify your account via mail, phone, video, live video call, or email. One of the most straightforward methods is by mail, where Google sends a postcard to your business address with a verification code. Once you receive the postcard, enter the code into your Google Business Profile to complete the verification process within 30 days of the initial request. Step 8: Optimize your profile After verification, it’s time to enhance and complete your profile. Here are key elements to focus on: Photos : Upload high-quality photos that represent your business. This may include a professional headshot , photos of your office, and images of properties you’ve sold. Visual content is crucial in real estate, as it helps clients get a sense of who you are and the type of transactions you handle. Business hours : This ensures clients know when they can reach you. Note that many agents promise 24/7 access, but unless this is the reality (and you have a team to support you on call at all hours), make sure that you add accurate hours of operation. Description : Write a compelling business description. Highlight your expertise, the services you offer, and what sets you apart from other agents. Use relevant keywords naturally in your description to enhance SEO. Reviews : Encourage satisfied clients to leave reviews on your profile . Responding to reviews, whether positive or negative, shows that you value client feedback and are committed to providing excellent service. Posts : Use the Posts feature to share updates, such as new listings, open houses, or market insights. Regular updates keep your profile active and engaging, which can attract more visitors. Step 9: Monitor and update your profile Your Google Business Profile is not a set-it-and-forget-it tool. Regularly monitor your profile, update your information as needed, and engage with clients through reviews and posts. Keeping your profile up-to-date ensures that your business continues to appear in relevant search results and maintains a positive online reputation.

Leveraging AI to support your Google Business Profile Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a powerful tool for setting up and optimizing your Google Business Profile as a real estate agent or broker. One of the most effective ways to leverage AI is to ask it to craft a compelling, keyword-rich business description that highlights your expertise, niche, and local market knowledge. AI can also help generate optimized responses to frequently asked questions, ensuring your Q&A section provides valuable information while improving search visibility. Regularly updating your Google Business Profile with posts about market trends, new listings, open houses, or client success stories is crucial, and AI can streamline this process by generating well-structured, engaging content.

When it comes to visuals, AI-powered tools can optimize images by suggesting captions, alt text, and even enhancements for photo and video quality, making your profile more appealing. Competitor analysis is another area where AI shines, as it can provide insights into how other agents optimize their profiles, helping you refine your strategy. Lastly, AI-driven scheduling tools can automate Google Business Profile updates, ensuring consistent engagement without requiring manual effort. By integrating AI into your strategy, you can save time, improve your profile’s visibility, and attract more potential clients.
