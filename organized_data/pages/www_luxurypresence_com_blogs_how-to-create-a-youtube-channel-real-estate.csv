Real estate YouTube marketing best practices Following YouTube marketing best practices will ensure you get the maximum benefit from your real estate video marketing efforts. Coherent visual branding Ensure each of these visual elements follows your overall branding style: Video intro slide Thumbnail Titles and subtitles Animations YouTube banner (also known as channel art or channel header, it’s the large banner displayed at the top of a YouTube channel’s homepage.) This includes logos, fonts, colors, titles, subtitles, and the overall color theme you use to create animations and text. Focus on viewer intent Many YouTube creators making video content for real estate struggle to find a balance between self-promotion and viewer-focused information, especially when starting out. Your videos should never seem salesy or spammy. Instead, keep the viewer’s objective in mind and focus on the value you offer through your visual content. Use multiple calls to action in your real estate YouTube videos Below are some essential YouTube CTAs to use in your videos: In your voiceovers or when speaking directly into the camera, prompt audiences to subscribe to your channel and click on the notification bell to be the first to hear about your latest content. Also, ask your audiences to comment and share your videos. Direct audiences to your other videos or website with pop-up CTAs . In YouTube Studio, go to the video you want to edit, click on “Cards,” and add a card, which will appear as a clickable pop-up during the video. You can link to other videos and playlists, but you will have to join the YouTube Partner Program in order to link to your site. Suggest related videos in your channel at the end of your content. To suggest related videos from your channel at the end of your YouTube videos, use the End Screen feature available in the YouTube Studio. You can add video elements in the last 5-20 seconds of your video, directing viewers to specific videos, playlists, or your channel. Again, if you want to use End Screens to include clickable links to your website, you will have to join the YouTube Partner Program. Include your social media links in your YouTube videos by adding them in the video description, which is editable in YouTube Studio. Additionally, you can include social media links in your channel banner by customizing your channel’s Basic Info section. Add them in the Links section and they will then appear as clickable icons on your banner. Offer your viewers freebies in exchange for giving you their contact information. For example, you could promote a free e-book on the homebuying process or a free home valuation in exchange for contact information. Recommend this lead magnet at the end of your video, and inform your viewers that they can find the link in the description box. When viewers click on the link, they’ll arrive at the landing page of your website where they will need to fill out a form with contact information to access the freebies.
