Up to 82% of real estate sales for agents with developed businesses come from previous clients, friends, and referrals. Whether you’ve received referrals from another agent, are looking to refer your own clients, or are interested in implementing a referral system to your team’s operations, it’s wise to get up to speed on the ins and outs of referral fees for real estate agents. In this quick guide, we walk through what real estate referrals are, the typical fee structure for a referral commission, how much a referral fee in real estate is, and how to craft effective referral agreements. Find It Fast What is a real estate referral? When a licensed agent refers a prospective buyer or seller to another licensed agent to handle a transaction, it is called a real estate referral. The referred agent becomes the buyer or seller’s primary representative, and the referring agent receives a fee if the transaction closes. Referrals can benefit all parties. Consumers often regard a referred agent as more trustworthy, and the referred agent gains a new, motivated client. The referring agent benefits by maintaining a positive relationship with the lead, taking work off their to-do list, and receiving a real estate referral fee. It’s important to note the ethics of referral fees, which focus on transparency, fairness, and compliance with legal guidelines. Referral fees must be disclosed to all parties involved, ensuring that the transaction remains above board. Agents receiving fees must ensure they provide value to the client, not merely profit from a connection. Ethical considerations also include avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring that clients’ best interests come first. The most common reasons for real estate referrals Referrals happen frequently in the real estate industry. These are some of the most common reasons a licensed real estate agent will refer out business: They’re on vacation or otherwise busy. They don’t specialize in the lead’s geographic area or the type of real estate they’re seeking. They are retiring and passing clients to their network. The dollar value of the deal is lower than their preferred threshold. They focus predominantly on referrals, not real estate transactions. How can I ask for a real estate referral fee? Requesting a referral fee is straightforward, especially if you make it part of the initial referral conversation. When making a referral to another agent, make sure you discuss and finalize the fee amount before connecting them with the client. Ask them to sign a real estate referral fee agreement, then facilitate the connection through text, email, phone call, or in-person meeting. This approach minimizes misunderstandings and lets you secure the agreement while you are still in a strong position for negotiation. How much do referring real estate agents earn? There is no fixed amount. Referring agents’ fees depend on the referred agent’s commissions, varying both based on the number and success of leads and the value of the deals. The typical real estate referral fee is 25% of the gross commission. Negotiating your referral fee Negotiating referral fees in real estate is a key skill for maximizing your income while maintaining professional relationships. By understanding the industry standards and establishing clear expectations, you can ensure a smooth negotiation process. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the negotiation of referral fees effectively. Understand industry standards : Research typical referral fees in your area, usually between 20% and 30% of the commission, to know what’s reasonable. Clarify roles : Make sure everyone understands their responsibilities in the transaction. Set expectations early : Agree on the referral fee percentage upfront to avoid confusion later. Negotiate based on value : If you’re referring high-value leads, negotiate a higher fee to reflect the potential commission. Put it in writing : Formalize the agreement with a written contract outlining the fee percentage and terms. Ensure compliance : Verify the referral fee arrangement complies with local regulations. Follow up : Stay in touch throughout the transaction to ensure the fee is paid as agreed. How much is a referral fee in real estate? Referral fees are contingent on deal closure, meaning no payment is required if the transaction doesn’t close, as the fee is tied to the commission. It’s also important to note that some states restrict the payment of real estate referral fees to licensed individuals only. Real estate referral fees are typically 25% of the referred agent’s gross commission. However, this ratio is negotiable. For instance, retiring agents might request a higher percentage in exchange for granting access to their network, while two agents may agree to a lower-than-standard rate when there are multiple referrals in play. Here are three examples of how real estate referral fees can be calculated: 25% referral fee : A referring agent introduces their past client to a listing agent. The home sells for $400,000 with a 5% commission ($20,000). The referral agent receives 25% of the total commission, amounting to $5,000. The remaining commission must be split between the listing agent and the buyer’s agent. 30% referral fee : A retiring agent refers a homeseller to a seller’s agent and negotiates a 30% fee. That property sells for $500,000. The total commission is $25,000, and the referral fee is 30%, resulting in $7,500 to the referring agent. Flat referral fee : A referring agent receives a flat fee of $2,000 for connecting a client to a listing agent, regardless of the sale price or commission percentage. If the property sells for $350,000 with a 6% commission, the referring agent receives the agreed-upon $2,000. What is the difference between a finder’s fee and a referral fee? A referral fee compensates licensed real estate agents or brokers for directing clients to another professional. A finder’s fee compensates non-licensed individuals who successfully locate a property or a real estate opportunity. Who pays the real estate referral fee? In typical real estate transactions, the referring agent who brings a client to another agent receives a referral fee from the agent who successfully closes the deal. The fee is deducted from their commission. If a third party is involved, the title company sends an additional check to the referring agent’s broker and the referring agent. Payment is generally received within ten days of closing. Why should I pay a real estate referral fee? There are several reasons why paying a referral fee makes smart business sense, including: Maintaining good professional relationships : Agreeing to pay a fair referral fee fosters future referrals, while not agreeing to one can sour your relationships with fellow agents and harm your professional reputation. Lowering the cost of acquiring business : Traditional lead acquisition is costly, and there’s no transaction guarantee. Paying 25% on commission only when the deal goes through is a conservative and reasonable outlay. How do I structure a real estate referral agreement? Creating a clear real estate referral agreement is crucial for mutual protection. It should be straightforward, outlining the referral, the referral fee, and the real estate transaction details. The National Association of Realtors provides a standard referral contract form . However, you might want to check with your state association to see if they offer a localized template agreement you can use. Some agents and brokers prefer to work with an attorney for custom language. What should every real estate referral fee agreement include? No matter which template you use, be sure to include these elements: Referring source (real estate broker/agent contact details, name, address, etc.) Receiving real estate broker/agent Breakdown of referral fee Terms of the agreement Signatures from agents and real estate brokers (A referral fee agreement binds the brokerage, not just the individual agent, which is why a broker’s signature is necessary to make the agreement enforceable).
