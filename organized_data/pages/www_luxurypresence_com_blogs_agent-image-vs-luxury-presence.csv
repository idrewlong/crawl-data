Our aesthetic is clean, elegant, and sophisticated, which appeals to high-end clients. Our designs have won multiple awards , highlighting our commitment to excellence. Madison Hildebrand’s The Malibu Life website is an excellent example of this. The top producer and reality star literally wrote the book on branding in real estate, and his partnership with Luxury Presence resulted in a website that showcases his star qualities, professionalism, Malibu aesthetic, and dedication to brand and design. Comprehensive marketing services : We offer a full suite of digital marketing services, including search engine optimization (SEO) campaigns, content marketing, social media management, and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, which helps agents build a strong online presence. This is only one of the reasons the top names in real estate are working with Luxury Presence to enhance their online presence. The tools that they can leverage make an actual difference to their bottom line. Exclusive tools : Our platform provides tools tailored for luxury real estate, such as advanced CRM integration, IDX/MLS listing feeds, and high-definition video tours, enhancing the user experience. Our detailed IDX home searches make it easy for buyers to find exactly the property they’re looking for, while the site captures valuable lead information. Proprietary platform: Websites are built on a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, which means the technology is being constantly improved and updated, unlike set-it-and-forget-it sites built on WordPress. Take a brief tour of our platform and the many tools and capabilities that drive success: Artificial intelligence : Our AI Lead Nurture chat feature keeps leads engaged until handoff to an agent. Luxury Presence also offers its complete AI-powered Copilot app , which can be white-labeled for the ultimate client-centric experience.

This higher standard of customer support is a significant advantage for agents who require reliable and immediate help. Let’s chat Choosing your website provider is a big decision, and you probably have questions. Get in touch Cons of using Luxury Presence Cost : Luxury Presence is not an entry-level product. Premium products and services have a cost, a cost that may not align with the budgets of some agents. Strong brand identity required : Solid branding and clear differentiation are necessary to be successful with the Luxury Presence platform. Though the team at Luxury Presence can absolutely help real estate professionals develop that brand strategy, this isn’t the right fit for anyone looking to operate a generic, mediocre business. Agent Image Agent Image is one of the longest-standing players in the real estate website design industry, with a broader market focus. They cater to a wide range of real estate professionals, from individual agents to large brokerages, providing customizable website solutions and digital marketing services. Agent Image products and services A range of real estate website design packages from template-based options to exclusive luxury designs with flexible inner page layouts and indexable listings—all with full ownership IDX solutions Digital marketing services: SEO, social media, PPC advertising, content development, and email marketing Example of an Agent Image site Pros of Agent Image Various design options : Agent Image offers a wide variety of design templates and customization options that cater to different styles and preferences, making it versatile for all types of agents. Entry level packages available : Their pricing structure is generally more flexible and affordable, with packages that can accommodate different budget levels. Generic platform : Agent Image sites are built on WordPress, which means you can take it with you if you decide to part ways with them. Cons of Agent Image Design consistency : While they offer many design options, the overall quality and consistency can vary, with some templates looking outdated compared to Luxury Presence’s sleek designs. Support : While Agent Image provides customer support, it has limited business hours and some users have reported longer response times and less personalized service compared to Luxury Presence’s round-the-clock assistance. Also, because their sites are built on WordPress, they can’t help you if that technology goes down. Technology : Agent Image uses WordPress to build your site, which means they don’t control the quality of the technology or availability of plugins used to make the site work. Questions to ask When making your final decision, it’s important to have all of the pertinent information, not just about the look and capabilities of your site, but also the mechanics behind it. Here are some critical questions to ask each provider: Would my website be built on WordPress or something more sophisticated, like a SaaS platform? Can you give me a tour of the backend of a typical site and help me understand the effort that goes into making changes or updates? Who handles making the changes to the site and what does that process look like? What are typical website speeds at launch and over time? What do you do to ensure my site’s speed does not slow as it ages? Is this a set-it-and-forget-it product, or are we partners as my career, website, and marketing needs grow and change over time? What kinds of artificial intelligence are you utilizing that will improve my clients’ experience and enhance my productivity? We find that when clients ask these types of questions, they see that Luxury Presence’s product is more suitable over the lifetime of an agent’s career. Agent Image Vs Luxury Presence: Final thoughts In the Agent Image vs Luxury Presence debate, it’s clear both companies offer valuable services that can help real estate agents build a strong online presence. However, they do cater to different needs and budgets.
