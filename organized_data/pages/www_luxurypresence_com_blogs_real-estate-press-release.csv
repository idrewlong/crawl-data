Whether you’re showcasing a groundbreaking development, celebrating a record-breaking sale, or positioning your brand as an industry innovator, a strategically crafted real estate press release can ensure your message speaks directly to your target audience’s aspirations. Find It Fast The power of a well-crafted press release A press release can be your secret weapon — a powerful narrative bridge that transforms ordinary property listings or updates into compelling stories of potential and possibility. More than just a traditional announcement, it’s your opportunity to breathe life into bricks and mortar, turning square footage into dreams, and professional milestones into transformative moments. Furthermore, press releases, and PR in general , help real estate professionals build their brands by positioning them as industry experts and increasing their visibility in the market. By sharing news about new listings, business milestones, or community involvement, agents can establish credibility and attract media coverage. Finally, a well-crafted press release not only boosts search engine optimization (SEO) by generating backlinks from reputable news sources but also enhances trust with potential clients by showcasing expertise and success. Consistently leveraging press releases as part of a broader marketing strategy helps agents stay top of mind and differentiate themselves in a competitive market.

Download now When to publish a press release Press releases allow you to effectively share achievements, partnerships, and exciting new ventures with your audience — showcasing your capabilities and establishing yourself as a trailblazer and industry leader. But when exactly should you plan on publishing a press release? Here are some examples of milestones that might merit an announcement: New property launches : Placing a new listing on the market is a great time to write a press release. You can use this medium to highlight the property’s unique features and why it stands out in the market. The strategy can also be a strong differentiator in your listing presentation to high-profile sellers. Significant sales : If you’ve just closed a large deal, whether a single high-value property or a number of properties, it’s time to drum up some press. Sharing news of significant sales demonstrates your capability as a real estate agent and builds trust with prospects. Industry awards : Recognition of your work is a clear indicator of your expertise in real estate. If a reputable industry organization has recognized you, your team, or your brokerage, share this news with your audience. This boosts your credibility and sets you apart from competitors. Partnership announcements : Teaming up with other real estate brokerages, financial institutions, charitable organizations, or development companies may be worth announcing publicly. It demonstrates that you’re expanding your community network and successfully scaling your business. Key elements of your real estate press release Here’s how you transform moments of success into a press release that captures the imagination of potential clients, journalists, and the community. The headline Think of your headline as the firm, confident handshake that introduces you to the world. Here are some strategies to ensure it’s bold, crisp, and representative of your brand: Capture the essence of your story in eight to ten words . A great headline should distill the key message of your press release into a concise, impactful statement. Aim for brevity while conveying the core of your announcement, whether it’s a new listing, a market trend, or a milestone achievement. Keep it clear and to the point to draw readers in. Consider the reader : It’s important to remember that the audience for your press release is the press, which is different from writing for prospective, current, or past clients. You want your content to appeal to journalists who will then cover your news. Create intrigue . Your headline should spark curiosity and make writers excited to share your story with their audience. Use action verbs and a sense of urgency. For example, “Revolutionary Property Technology Transforms Real Estate Experience” is more engaging than simply stating “New Property Technology Hits Real Estate Market.” Highlight the unique angle . Focus on what makes your story stand out in a crowded media landscape. Whether it’s an innovative approach, an exclusive listing, or a significant accomplishment, consider what sets your news apart from competitors and weave that into your headline to make it compelling and newsworthy.

Get started now Crafting the main body of your real estate press release The introduction is your chance to grab the reader’s attention immediately. Using the classic journalistic approach, answer the who, what, when, where, and why, but present it in a way that is not overly formal. The body of your press release is where you expand on the story and provide more detailed information. Use an inverted pyramid structure, placing the most important details at the top and working down to the less critical ones. This structure makes it easy for busy writers and assignment editors to digest the essential information quickly, while also allowing them to dive deeper into the context if they choose. To add authority and authenticity to your release, be sure to include quotes from key stakeholders, such as yourself, company executives, industry experts, or local influencers. Quotes help humanize the release and provide additional perspectives. Supporting data, whether it’s market analysis or property specifics, further reinforces your message and enhances credibility. Adding access to more information Once the reader has reached the end of the main section of your press release, don’t leave them hanging. Direct them on what to do next in the “More Info” section. This could be an offer of high resolution photos, a way to answer follow-up questions, or a method of directing the reader to your website. Ending the press release Finally, end the release with a brief About Us paragraph, which provides background on your company or organization. This section should focus on your mission, values, and any relevant achievements or expertise, ensuring that readers understand the context of who is behind the announcement and why they should trust your insights. This brief closing summary rounds out the press release and provides essential background for readers unfamiliar with your business. It’s traditional to include a notation to indicate the end of the press release. While this is a holdover from the days of wire services, most journalists still expect to see it. The most common symbol is “###” but you may also use “-30-” or “-END-” if you prefer. The final polish A press release should feel as meticulously crafted as a tailored suit. Every word should fit perfectly, and every sentence should flow seamlessly, presenting your company in the best possible light. This step is not just about catching grammatical errors — though that is certainly important — but about refining your language to ensure your unique value proposition and personal brand shine through. Each section of the release should serve a clear purpose, advancing the story while maintaining a cohesive tone that reflects your values and professionalism. Read the full press release aloud to ensure that the language is precise and impactful. Replace technical jargon or buzzwords with lay terms the journalist and their readers will easily understand. How to write a real estate press release using AI Writing a press release about your real estate business can be time-consuming, but AI can streamline the process and enhance the quality of your content. Here’s how real estate professionals can use AI to write an effective press release: Identify the key message . Whether you’re announcing a new property listing, a partnership, or a technology upgrade, AI tools can help you clearly pinpoint and concisely structure the most important details. Generate an attention-grabbing headline . AI-powered writing tools like ChatGPT can assist in crafting a headline that is both compelling and informative. Input your main topic into the AI tool, and ask it to suggest multiple headline options based on the key message of your press release. Draft the body of the press release . AI can assist in drafting the body of the press release by helping you outline the main points and supporting details. Provide the AI tool with a brief summary of what you’d like to include, such as background information, quotes, or product details, and it can generate a well-structured draft for you. Optimize for SEO . AI can also help optimize your press release for search engines by suggesting relevant keywords, making your content more discoverable. This is especially helpful when you’re sharing your press release through digital platforms. Edit and refine . Once you’ve got a draft, use AI-powered grammar and style-checking tools to ensure your press release is error-free and polished. Tools like Grammarly or Hemingway can help you fine-tune your content, improving readability and ensuring consistency. Tailor the release for different platforms . AI tools can transform your press release into a blog post or content for your social media.

Download now Best practices and mistakes to avoid Here are some dos and don’ts to help you craft the perfect tone for your real estate press release. Do: Keep it concise and focused : Busy journalists want to immediately understand the most critical information. For example, focus on your new listing’s unique selling points and not the long history of the neighborhood, which a writer would be able to research themselves if they wanted to include it. Use a professional tone : A press release is not a casual blog post. Maintain a tone that uses clear, professional language and avoid colloquial expressions. Include relevant keywords for SEO : Optimize your press release for search engines so it has a stronger chance of being found. Use SEO keywords related to real estate , such as “new home for sale,” “luxury property listing,” or “real estate agent in {city}.” Make it newsworthy : Make sure the content is valuable for the audience and interesting. For example, a press release about a meet-and-greet with a celebrity interior designer offers your audience an event of value, where a run-of-the-mill property listing announcement does not. Don’t: Use jargon : While some industry language is unavoidable, excessive use can alienate your audience. Avoid using technical real estate terms that the average reader won’t understand. Go overboard : While the ultimate aim of a press release is to promote your business, it shouldn’t read like an advertisement. Rather than talking up your services, focus on providing useful information to your audience. Bury the lead : The most important information should be at the beginning of your press release. Writers and editors will be more likely to stop reading the release than to go hunting for the main point. Forget to proofread : Journalists are trained to look for typos and will interpret grammatical errors as a lack of professionalism. Always proofread your work or ask for an additional pair of eyes to confirm it’s good to publish. Getting the word out Once you’ve written a press release, disseminate it strategically to maximize its impact. Here are some options: Distribute via a press release service : Platforms like PR Newswire , Business Wire , or GlobeNewswire can help get your press release in front of journalists, bloggers, and industry professionals. However, these options tend to be quite expensive, and they certainly don’t guarantee results. Pitch to local and industry media : Send personalized emails to local newspapers, real estate publications, and industry bloggers who may be interested in covering your news. Highlight why your announcement is relevant to their audience. Leverage your website and blog : Turn your presser into a compelling blog post or website update. Remember to shift the point of view so that it speaks to consumers, rather than journalists. Share on social media : Post key highlights from your press release on platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram . Use professional groups and hashtags to reach a broader audience. Repurpose for additional content : Turn the press release into a LinkedIn article, video announcement, or newsletter feature to extend its reach and impact across different channels.
