Together, these two industry powerhouses transformed SERHANT.’s digital strategy, focusing on simplifying operations for agents and enhancing the brand’s national and global presence. The Challenge: Crafting a Global Brand and Empowering Agents As a well-regarded New York brokerage, SERHANT.’s pivot into a globally recognized brand necessitated attention to detail and a deft hand.

The Strategy: Tailored Digital Solutions for Brand and Agent Growth Luxury Presence developed a multifaceted strategy emphasizing ease of use for agents, robust brand presentation, and scalable solutions for growth. Key features and implementations: Brand integration and visual design: The redesign focused on incorporating SERHANT.’s distinctive brand elements, such as its signature blue color and capital S logo, into the website.

Captivating the Industry, the Nation, and the World Following the premiere of “Owning Manhattan” on Netflix — which stars the brokerage’s founder and CEO, Ryan Serhant — the brokerage experienced a remarkable global surge. In one week, the website attracted 2.3 million additional visitors, with users spending four times the industry average on the site. This resulted in record-breaking new account sign-ups and saved searches and showcased the website’s ability to handle heavy traffic, engage users, and convert interested viewers into leads.
