A professional headshot conveys trust, approachability, and competence — qualities that are essential in real estate, where client relationships are key. An exceptional headshot does more than just introduce you; it helps attract your ideal client. By aligning your headshot with your brand — whether that’s conveying luxury, approachability, or expertise — you can better connect with the clients you want to serve.

Download your worksheet Steps to achieving the perfect real estate headshots Before diving into your headshot session, it’s essential to understand the key steps that will help you achieve a polished, professional result. These steps will ensure that your headshot not only represents you accurately but also aligns seamlessly with your personal brand. 1. Hire a professional photographer Investing in a professional photographer is crucial. A skilled photographer understands how to highlight your best features and capture your personality in a way that resonates with your brand. When choosing a photographer, review portfolios, ask for references, and ensure they have experience in creating professional headshots. The cost of a professional photo shoot for a headshot typically ranges from $150 to $500, depending on factors like the photographer’s experience, the location, and the number of final images you receive. High-end photographers or additional services, such as makeup and hair styling, may cost more. 2. Align on the vision Before your photoshoot, have an in-depth conversation with your photographer about your brand, target audience, and the message you want your headshot to convey. Send them your bio and any other marketing collateral that represents your brand. If you have a style guide or brand book , be sure to share it with the photographer in advance. Discuss your style preferences, potential locations, and outfit choices to ensure everything aligns with your brand image. This preparation will help your photographer capture the essence of your professional identity. 3. Choose the right location The location of your headshot can greatly influence the impression it makes. Choose a setting that complements your niche or business focus . For example, if you specialize in luxury homes, consider a high-end property as your backdrop. If you work primarily in urban areas, a cityscape might be more appropriate. Select a location that underlines and enhances your brand’s story. In this example, Corcoran Group team leader Holly Sose does a brilliant job of firmly positioning her professional photo in her geographic location. Her photo distinguishes her as not just a real estate expert, but one who genuinely knows the streets of New York. New York associate broker Holly Sose, as captured by photographer Karya Schanilec 4. Select appropriate attire Your clothing should reflect the professionalism you bring to your work. Opt for solid, neutral colors, such as navy, gray, or white, that photograph well. Avoid busy patterns that can distract from your face. You’re looking for an outfit that photographs well, not necessarily what looks great in person. You might want several different ensembles for different uses — a more formal one for general use and a more casual one for social media or other marketing. Accessories should be minimal and tasteful, ensuring that the focus remains on you, not what you have on. Remember, your attire should also align with the message you want to convey—whether that’s polished sophistication or approachable warmth. 5. Pay attention to hair and makeup To look your best, consider hiring a professional hairstylist and makeup artist. If you have facial hair, make sure it’s trimmed and well-groomed. If you’re comfortable in make-up, stick with a minimalist, natural style. The goal is to look like the best version of yourself, so keep it simple and refined. 6. Prepare for the photo shoot On the day of the shoot, practice good posture and relax. Confidence is key, so take a few moments to center yourself before stepping in front of the camera. A relaxed, genuine smile will help you appear more approachable and trustworthy — two essential qualities in real estate. Be sure to take breaks when you need them; posing for multiple photos is more taxing than you’d think. 7. Suggest edits as needed After a professional headshot session, real estate agents should focus on a few key post-edit tasks to ensure the final image is polished and aligns with their brand. First, they should review the proofs and select the best shot that captures their personality while maintaining a professional appearance. Next, communicate with the photographer about any specific retouching needs, such as adjusting lighting, smoothing skin tones, or enhancing the background. It’s essential to ensure that the edits are subtle and natural, avoiding overly airbrushed effects. Finally, consider resizing the image for different platforms, ensuring it meets the required dimensions for social media profiles, business cards, and websites. Using AI for your real estate headshots Artificial intelligence can be used to create a professional headshot, offering a cost-effective and convenient alternative to traditional photography. By leveraging AI tools , you can generate high-quality images that reflect your brand and personality. These tools allow for customization, including new background choices, facial expressions, and attire, ensuring your headshot aligns with your professional image. However, while AI can produce impressive results, it’s important to ensure the final image accurately represents you, maintaining authenticity in your personal branding. Some popular AI tools for creating professional headshots include Remini , Dreamwave , HeadshotPro , and AI SuitUp . Using your real estate headshots Once you’ve received your headshots, update all your digital platforms. This includes your website, social media profiles , and any other online presence. Consistency is crucial; ensure that your new headshot is the same across all platforms to maintain a cohesive brand image. Update your headshot whenever your appearance changes significantly. Even if you haven’t changed your look, it’s still a good idea to refresh your headshot every few years to keep it current. Building a relationship with your photographer can make this process smoother and more enjoyable.
