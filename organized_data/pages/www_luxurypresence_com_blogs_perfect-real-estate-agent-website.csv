That’s why having an online presence that is second to none is so important in a competitive market. But with so many options and moving parts, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. At Luxury Presence, we build real estate websites for agents that are beautiful and award-winning. In this playbook, we’ll cover everything you need to create a top-notch real estate website . From elevated website design to search engine optimization (SEO) , you’ll learn the elements necessary to build a high-performing website that helps you grow your real estate business faster, smarter, and easier. So whether you’re starting from scratch or giving your existing website a facelift, we’ll show you how to create a website that engages your audience and converts visitors into clients. The Importance of Having an Agent Website Having a strong online presence is more important than ever in today’s digital world. It’s why so many real estate agents have their own websites. But, before you start building your agent website, you need to understand exactly how it can benefit your brand. Boosts Relevant Traffic Businesses today rely on the internet for everything. Why? Because that’s where the customer pool is hiding. Smaller enterprises and agencies report an increase in growth between 15% and 50% from using a webpage service. And to further strengthen that point, 91% of customers have been recorded saying they prefer an online experience with the businesses they frequent. Maintaining an online presence, specifically through a website, can do wonders for your traffic. A good example of the impact of an online presence on increased traffic comes from a case study on a particular Singaporean website specializing in realty. The study shows an organic reach of close to 500k with just the simple execution of a basic homepage design. This growth further increased to 2.4m following actionable steps in SEO, website design, link building, and other similar services you can find with Luxury Presence. Powerful Lead Generation Instrument The right real estate website can also boost your lead generation efforts. Think about it: most people use the internet when searching for answers to something. If you can identify your target audience’s burning questions and provide helpful solutions, quality leads will come straight to you for answers. By positioning your website as an invaluable resource page, your audience will not only recognize you as an authority figure in the real estate industry but will also begin to build a trusting relationship with your brand. And when the time comes when they need a real estate agent, you and your brand will be top of mind. You can even further entice them to convert by placing strategic call-to-actions (CTAs) on your webpage. Customer Education Medium Customer education is equally vital to a real estate business. You can ensure your client pool knows what they need to by providing the right resources to compare and contrast on your website. An effective way to educate your audience is to include blogs, videos, podcasts, and more so that your customers can see what happens behind the scenes at a real estate agency. Once they understand what you can do for them, they’ll be more likely to call on you whenever they need realty services. 24/7 Communication Channel Your website can also take on the key function of being a communications channel for your business. Use a contact form and integrate a live chat system to allow 24/7 open communication with your customers. You can even link your company’s social media pages to your main website to further facilitate engagement with your audience. Connecting to your social media platforms allows for quick problem-solving or post-sales servicing which serves as a gold mine for advancing your lead generation efforts. Simplifies Analytics & Data Processing Having a website makes it incredibly simple to extract customer data and analyze your target audience so that you can serve them better. Websites can now be linked to a myriad of integrations that compile the data into easy-to-use charts and tables—allowing you to see which of your marketing strategies are working and which aren’t. These tools also provide you with a picture of your customers’ average daily website usage patterns and how they perceive information about real estate. Do they prefer long-winded, technical explanations of what to expect when buying a house? Or are they the more easy-reader types who just want to know the significant bits? Brand & Business Credibility Having a website lends credibility to your business and the services you offer. Including things like testimonials, reviews, and even blog posts can significantly boost trust and strengthen your rapport with your loyal and potential audience pools. Not to mention, websites do wonders for your brand awareness scores too. Check out some of the amazing real estate websites we’ve designed for our clients . Analyzing the Elements of a Webpage Chapter 1: 6 Features of a Top-Notch Real Estate Website Now you understand the benefits a simple collection of landing pages can bring you, it’s time to go over the features that constitute a top-notch real estate website. Chapter 2: Web Design Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and executing the basic structural arrangements of your home page and other supporting pages. It involves designing both the aesthetical aspects and the navigational ones. With many more consumers spending their time on their smartphones and handheld devices, website design now includes developing mobile-compatible pages. Chapter 3: User Interface (UI/UX) User interfaces are the front-end aspects of a website that you get to see and interact with. The menu items, tabs that take you places, contact forms that help you send messages, and even nifty animations are part of the UI/UX . As you know, webpages are made up of code. The UI/UX layer helps mask this messy jumble of words and numbers to keep the “front door” to your website clean, simple, and, most importantly, easy to use. Chapter 4: Website Copy Website copy is the core content of your landing pages, a.k.a the text that tells the story of your brand, what it does, and what it offers. Website copy isn’t to be confused with website content, which is filler text that conveys ideas and concepts about your realty niche, like a blog post. The primary duty of copy is to help convert leads to successful sales. Chapter 5: SEO SEO , or search engine optimization, is a group of strategies and processes that, when done correctly, propel your website to the highest position in search result pages. SEO applies to any search engine —Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Youtube (yes, YouTube is a search engine!) Chapter 6: Social Media Integration Social media and web design are inseparable elements when building an effective and engaging real estate agent’s website. Any 21st-century business needs to integrate social media into its marketing plans. Through social media, you can share information on properties, industry and market news, clients’ success stories, company milestones, and new listings. Chapter 7: Internet Data Exchange (IDX) Integration The IDX is a plug-in software that contains standards, best practices, and policies related to displaying the information in real estate listings on websites. This powerful tool allows agents and brokers to integrate listings from the Multiple Listing Services (MLS). With the MLS , real estate agents in a particular location can upload, share, and manage local listings.
