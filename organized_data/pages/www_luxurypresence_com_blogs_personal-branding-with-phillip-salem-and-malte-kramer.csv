Find It Fast Embracing authenticity to build trust A major takeaway from Salem’s journey is that success in personal branding for real estate agents requires authenticity. Early in his career, he felt pressured to conform to the industry’s image. “Four or five years ago, when I first got my license, I was shopping for ties and suit jackets,” said Salem. “Because everybody that I saw that was successful was in a suit and tie.” However, he soon realized that wasn’t his true self. “Over the last two years, I was like, ‘This is not me. I do not do suits and ties,’” he recalled. “So, I started just wearing whatever I wanted to showings. I stopped caring if people liked me or didn’t like me, and my business went up 500%.” Salem believes that people are drawn to authenticity, and he has built a loyal client base by presenting himself in a way that aligns with his personality. “They started realizing that and they appreciate that,” he said, advising other agents to embrace who they are, rather than trying to fit a mold. “Literally think about who you are as a person, how you want to present yourself… the right clients will find you.” Standing out through creative marketing Salem has always made branding a priority, launching his personal website as his first step. “Having that website as the first thing that people see if they don’t even know you” is important, he explained. “They can see about you; they can see your recent sales.” For Salem, creating a website that truly reflected his personality and business was a top priority. “I remember when I started my [Luxury Presence] website, I had so many ideas and you guys never said no. I’m like, ‘I want to put this here. I want to put this picture here. I want to put my TV show on the front page. I want to put all these ideas.’ And it was always a, ‘Yes, yes, yes.’” A well-designed website does more than showcase listings — it tells a story, builds trust, and helps agents attract the right clients. By integrating his personal style, content, and digital presence into his website, Salem ensured that every visitor could instantly understand who he is and what sets him apart in his competitive real estate market.

His branding efforts went even further when he placed eye-catching ads throughout New York’s West Chelsea neighborhood. The campaign — titled “Not Your Basic Broker” — featured Salem in high-fashion outfits. These ads reinforced his unique identity and successfully attracted clients who resonated with his authentic and vibrant personality. “Those ads worked,” he said. “Having those ads down in West Chelsea in a more art-predominant neighborhood really branded myself as like, ‘Oh, I like this guy. He’s cool; he’s like me. I want to work with him.’” Salem’s unique approach to branding has led to incredible opportunities, including at least one a multi-million-dollar transaction. One of his most notable deals involved representing the buyer for Ariana Grande’s apartment. “I met my buyer on the street. She noticed one of my Not Your Basic Broker ads and said, ‘Are you a real estate agent? I see your ads everywhere,’” he recalled. “I always say, great brand marketing means you will have people approaching you and saying things like, ‘I feel like I already know you.’” Rewrite your brand strategy Our free resources can help you define your personal brand, level up your marketing plan, and reach your target audience. Download your worksheet Creating content that connects Beyond static advertisements, Salem has built a reputation through video content . He understands that real estate is a highly competitive, transactional business, and he wanted to ensure that his brand resonated with his audience. First, Salem created “Three Things with Agent P,” a show highlighting his favorite shopping destinations, restaurants, and a top neighborhood listing. It was, as he put it, “just something different to brand myself as a human. Real estate is so transactional, and I want people that work with me to know that I’m not just selling an apartment. I’m selling a full lifestyle.” As the show gained traction, people kept telling him that he should be on reality TV. Instead of waiting for an opportunity, Salem made it happen himself by creating a reality show offering an unfiltered glimpse into his life. “It’s [my] whole world,” he said. “I called the production company, we created this show called ‘Agent P’s World,’ and they followed me around for about 45 days. We filmed probably 40 scenes total.” For Salem, the goal isn’t just entertainment — it’s about helping potential clients get to know him beyond the transaction. “It helps people who don’t know me understand who I am as a person. And they’re like, ‘Oh, I like the way he carries himself. I like that he lives his true authentic self. There are 30,000 real estate agents in New York, but I want to work with him,’” he said. Kindness builds businesses Beyond authentic branding, Salem also believes that building trust comes down to how you treat people. He stresses the importance of staying humble and approachable, no matter how successful you become. “You never know who you’re going to meet. Always be friendly to everybody,” he advised. “It’s so funny because some real estate agents… can have arrogant egos, and they think they’re better than somebody because they’re selling a certain amount of money or making a certain amount of money. Not me — ever.” For Salem, genuine kindness and authenticity aren’t just personal values — they’re key business strategies that have helped him build meaningful client relationships and open doors to unexpected opportunities. By staying true to himself, he’s created a personal brand that resonates with people beyond just real estate, reinforcing that trust and relatability are just as important as market expertise. Consistency is key When Salem thinks about personal branding for real estate agents, he understands it’s not a one-time effort — it’s an ongoing commitment . He consistently produces content, hosts events, and stays active on social media. “Even if it’s a slow month and I’m not selling real estate, I’m like, ‘Oh, I’m going to show people what I’m doing today with my dogs,’” he said. When asked how he keeps up with the constant demand for content, his answer was simple. “If you have passion in what you do, it just becomes natural,” he said. “When I see the finished product — whether it be selling an apartment, seeing the TV show, or looking at an ad I created — it makes me feel fulfilled.” The future of branding in real estate Looking ahead , Salem envisions expanding his team, growing his fashion business, and continuing his journey in television. But one thing remains constant: his commitment to branding. “I refuse to let anybody stop me from doing what I love,” he said. For real estate agents looking to build their brand, Salem’s story offers a clear message: Embrace who you are, create content that reflects your personality, and stay consistent.
