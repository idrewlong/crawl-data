But even if you’re working with an expert, it’s smart to stay in the know about SEO so you can ask the right questions and understand exactly what is impacting your website performance. Get this: Google uses over 200 factors to determine where websites show up in search results, some of which are publicly confirmed and some of which they keep close to the chest. But don’t let that stress you out! Our SEO team has narrowed the list down to the top Google ranking factors to focus on if you want to see improvement in your rankings, which we’ll dive into below. Find It Fast Top Google ranking factors The following are ranking factors directly confirmed by Google or widely agreed upon by the SEO community. Content relevance and quality Content refers to the written and visual information on your page, including copy, video, and images. And the quality of that content matters to Google. You want your content to be contextually relevant to the purpose of the page and to incorporate keywords naturally. Google is very good at analyzing content and highly values relevancy and quality, so it’s important to put real thought into what problem a page is trying to solve and provide helpful, topical answers. Keyword stuffing On the flip side, stuffing keywords into a blog post has a confirmed negative impact on a page’s ranking. In earlier days of SEO, a common method for getting a page to rank was to add a keyword as many times as possible, no matter how awkward it made the copy sound. That’s no longer the case. Google is adept at natural language processing, and saying the same thing over and over does not work. In fact, Google is likely to penalize sites and pages that do this. Keywords Having said that, keywords are obviously still an extremely important ranking factor. Keywords should appear in headlines, copy, videos, captions, and other places on your page. It’s how and where they show up that matters, which is why a good content strategy is critical . Title tags While they might not be the most important factor in Google rankings, title tags matter because they’re the first impression that someone gets of your website. Your title tag appears as a link on the search engine results page (SERP) and should briefly explain what the page is about. While there’s technically no limit to how long a title tag can be, Google will truncate the text to around 60 characters. Core Web Vitals Core Web Vitals are another confirmed Google ranking factor. Essentially, they are a measurement of your page’s performance and what kind of experience a user will have when visiting it. They include Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which measures loading First Input Delay (FID), which measures interactivity, and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which measures visual stability. In non-technical speak, this means things such as how long it takes the largest image on the page to load and how long it takes before a visitor can interact with a page. Page headings These relate to headlines and subheadlines, which give your page structure and help users navigate it. As long as they are well-written and contextually relevant, Google will use these to better understand your page. In the example below, the page heading includes high-value keywords that are relevant to someone searching for what it’s like to move to San Francisco. Location When you set up your Google Business Profile or your website is crawled and indexed, your address is collected. Because Google knows the general location of its users, their proximity to your address affects how high you’ll rank. For example, if someone in Boston is searching for “TX real estate agents,” your website may not appear at all, while it will show up for someone who is searching from Dallas. Anchor text Another confirmed Google ranking factor, anchor text is the text on a button or a link that points the visitor to a different page. While “Read More” or “Click Here” are commonly used, descriptive text is more helpful when it comes to SEO. For example, rather than using “Read More” to direct someone to a blog post about fun things to do in Miami, your link could instead say, “Our 10 Favorite Things to Do in Miami.” By including keywords in your anchor text, you let Google know what the linked page is about. HTTPS, not HTTP This factor is pretty straightforward: Google wants you to use HTTPS rather than HTTP. HTTPS is a secure communication protocol that tells a browser to encrypt data, which is important for protecting your site and user data. Mobile responsiveness As of Q4 2022, 59.16 percent of global website traffic came from mobile devices . Google grades websites on how they perform on mobile, so making sure your pages are mobile-optimized is very important. Backlinks When another website links to your website, that’s called a backlink. The more credible and authoritative the website that links to yours is, the more Google will factor that in. Getting a link from the New York Times, for example, will have a lot more value than a link from a random blog. While not officially confirmed, the following is considered a probable Google ranking factor. Alt text Alt text means “alternative text” and is a description of images, graphics, or videos on a website that is read by screen readers. This makes your website more accessible, which is a good practice regardless of SEO factors. Alt text can also help inform what is on the page and is considered a probable Google ranking factor. The following are not considered direct Google ranking factors—but they still provide a positive user experience for anyone visiting your website. External links External links add value for your site visitors. For example, if you’re writing a blog post about the best restaurants in Dallas, you’ll likely include a link to each restaurant’s website. Including these links save your readers time and hassle, but there’s little value to your own website rankings. Meta description It used to be that including keywords in your website description could help improve your rankings. Today, they only serve to provide more information and help entice someone to click on your site—useful, but not a direct ranking factor. Word count There’s a lot of chatter online about the length of blog posts and other website content. But the truth is, a 500-word post isn’t worse or better than one with 2,000 words. There’s no magic number— word count is simply not a Google ranking factor . What matters is a page’s quality, as mentioned earlier. The only “right” word count for a blog post is the number of words you need to deliver a page’s message in a relevant, thoughtful way. Content date When a piece of content was published generally does not affect a website’s ranking. The only nuance here is when someone is searching for content about a specific timeframe. For example, a search for lists of the top vacation spots in 2023 will often, though not always, show more recent content pieces. It’s important to note that republishing existing content with a new date will not improve search rankings.

But we keep a pulse on all the latest changes and updates to make sure the real estate professionals we work with always stay competitive in search results .
