You can easily add new pages to your website or edit existing pages. Do I need a custom domain for each property? No, we provide free subdomains on your Luxury Presence account. However, you can still purchase a custom domain and connect it to your property site through our platform. Do these integrate with my CRM? Yes, One-click Properties can integrate with the same CRM you’re already using. These include the industry staples like Contactually, Follow Up Boss, Sendgrid, and Compass. As long as there’s a Zapier integration, it will connect to your CRM. Are they SEO-friendly? Wouldn’t it be better to list my properties on my agent site? Google tends to rank single-property sites higher. Why? They are very specific and tend to drive the user to take action. Can I integrate the micro-sites to paid campaigns on IG/FB/Google? Yes, property websites are a great method to drive leads. They are designed with conversion and user experience as the highest priority.
