At the same time, brokerage marketing managers must ensure their top agents have early access to both on- and off-market opportunities to stay ahead. However, the traditional methods of sharing these listings — spreadsheets, emails, phone calls, and meetings — are inefficient and prone to missed opportunities. Luxury Presence’s new Brokerage Listing Network streamlines this process by centralizing all office and brokerage listings in one easy-to-access hub. This powerful tool enhances collaboration, gives agents a competitive edge with priority access, and ensures brokerages can provide the high-value opportunities their agents need to succeed. Formally released earlier this month at Inman Connect New York, this offering enables brokers to create internal listing networks, often referred to as in-house listings, for seamless property sharing and marketing within a unified ecosystem. A small group of brokerages, including SERHANT., 8z, and National Parks Realty, are already using the tool, with plans to expand access to all enterprise clients later this year. The National Association of Realtors’ Clear Cooperation Policy (CCP) , adopted in 2019, requires brokerages to publicly list properties on a multiple listing service (MLS) within 24 hours of signing a listing agreement. While intended to ensure transparency and cooperation by tamping down private listing networks, the policy has sparked heated debates within the industry. Some argue CCP limits strategic flexibility, while others believe it levels the playing field. “This is about solving a problem that most brokerages face today,” said Malte Kramer, CEO of Luxury Presence. “We’re not advocating for or against CCP , but we want to make sure our customers have the technology to succeed in any scenario.” Luxury Presence’s platform incorporates advanced controls to ensure privacy and professionalism in how listings are shared. For example, brokers can maintain owner privacy while guaranteeing that agents accessing the listings are well-trained and working with qualified clients. This approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also strengthens cooperation and trust within the brokerage. Additionally, the tool offers the ability to share listings with consumers via password-protected URLs, accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. By combining security with convenience, this feature ensures a seamless experience for agents and their clients. Kramer noted that Luxury Presence designed the new feature specifically to meet existing industry “demand for tools that empower brokerages to work with private listings more effectively.” This is just the latest development in Luxury Presence’s ongoing evolution as a forward-thinking technology partner for real estate professionals. From its beginnings as a website developer for luxury brands, the company has become a comprehensive software provider , offering innovative solutions to meet the changing needs of the industry. By empowering agents and brokers with tools that simplify processes, enhance privacy, and adapt to regulatory changes, Luxury Presence continues to demonstrate its commitment to helping brokerages thrive in a dynamic real estate landscape.
